# CHEME-7770-fianl-project
This is the respirotory for the CHEME 7770 final project jointly made by Alexus Locke (adl232) and Apratim Jash (aj623). In this respiratory we have included the written project report, three different Jupyter files containg the codes for simulation by random walk theory for diffusion controlled mechanism. Tau leaping algorithm with Michaelis Menten kinetics for the kinteic controlled mechanism and a the code for simulation that considers the combined effects of both mechanisms. The calculations related to Spatial arrangements vs rate constant has been presneted as an excel file.
